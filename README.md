CAD designed a mount for a spray bottle with motors controlling the pitch and yaw movement of the nozzle. 
A motor also controls the trigger so that the "water gun" can be shot remotely.

 - Z or R must first be pressed to set the positions of the motors. <br/>
 - W A S D or the arrow keys can be used to adjust pitch and yaw. <br/>
